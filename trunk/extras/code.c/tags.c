NOTE for tagging walls.  A red sector wall is actually two walls: An inside and an
outside wall.  Both are tagable by placing the cursor to the inside and outside
of the wall. 

In certain cases it is important to tag specifically the inside or the outside wall.
In others, it does not matter (exp: switches).  The tags list should tell you if a 
certain wall should be tagged.

Z COORDINATES AND PIXELS
------------------------

One pixel in height is equal to 256 Z coordinates.
Therefore a height of 2 pixels is a Z value of 512.

TAGGING POINTS VS WALLS
------------------------

A RED WALL is actually a single point that connects to another point.  So when you are
tagging a RED WALL you are actually tagging a single X,Y location on the map.  Sometimes
it can be difficult to tell what wall goes with what point.  When tagging a specific
point it may be necessary to check the walls x,y location to know if you have the right
wall.  Placing the player directly on the point you want to tag also helps because the
players x,y location is always shown at the bottom.


Note that "inside" walls go clockwise and "outside" walls go counter clockwise.

// Tracks allow SOs and sprites to follow a path designated by the map-maker.
// All Tracks must have at a minimum:
//      1. A TRACK_START.
//      2. A TRACK_END.
//
// Tracks are set up by the program by connecting sprites placed by the map-maker in the BUILD 
// editor.  The track sprites start at location 1900 and end at 1999 so there are 100 available
// tracks.  Tracks automatically loop back to the beginning when the TRACK_END sprite is
// detected.  Track tags listed below can be set to modify the behavior of objects moving along 
// them.
//
// Look at the tracks in example maps to see how they are placed.
//
// NOTE: Track direction is dependent on the next closest sprite to the TRACK_START sprite.
// As noted below, certain track tags are dependant on the direction the object is traveling on
// on the track.
//
// For placing actor sprite on the tracks:
//      1. Put a sprite down near the point you want it to start from.
//      2. Adjust the angle to the left to make the sprite move in the "reverse" direction
//         and to the right to make the sprite move in the "forward" direction.
//      3. For the pic, place the first pic of the actor found in the editart file.
//
// Every track can have a type set in the high tag of TRACK_START.

QUICK TRACK (tm) FEATURES    

    Quick Tracks (tm) save Mappers time in placing certain types of tracks.
    They let you place a single sprite for a track instead of 3 or 4.  See
    ACTOR.MAP for examples.

    Quick Jump -  Place "QJ" sprite (located next to ST1) and set
    TRACK_ACTOR_QUICK_JUMP in lotag, jump height in high tag, and turn angle to
    dirction of jump.  NOTE that jump height is not required and generally
    should not be used unless the actors are not doing what they are supposed
    to.  The program will figure the jump height.

    Quick Jump Down - Place "QJD" sprite similar to "QJ".

    Quick Super Jump -  "QSJ" sprite.  Only used by creatures that can jump
    really high (panther, ripper).

    Quick Scan -  Just like the scan track only a single sprite.
        
    NO they're not REALLY TradeMarked!  I was just goof'in on ya!

********************************************************************************
Added a track type so Actors can lie in wait for a player to come within a
certain distance, then continue on the track.  Can create all sorts of "hard
wired" or "canned" situations where ninja's pop out at you when you get close.

    Enter a room and ninja's hiding behind boxes, do super leaps over (or on top
    of) boxes to attack you.
    
    Ninjas hiding in the shadows in low crawl ways.
    
    Ninjas crouching on ledge passages that jump down to attack you.
    
    Ninjas crouching on bridges.
    
    Super leap from "under" the water to attack.
    
Another track type.  Same as above except that they are set in motion by a
trigger.  This way a bunch of ninja's can act as if they are working together
and attack at once.

********************************************************************************

As I implement Actor Code and such I will sometimes define (very generally) in
LOGIC sections what is going on in the code to let you guys know what is
happening logic wise.  Read it! :)

NOTE: Look at tags.h for Track Type (TT_name) descriptions.

LOGIC: RUN WAY

    A ninja runs away when his health is low and on a random number.

    Ninja looks for track types near by in this order.
    
    1. TT_EXIT
    2. TT_LADDER
    3. TT_TRAVERSE
    4. TT_STAIRS
    5. TT_JUMP_UP
    6. TT_JUMP_DOWN
    7. TT_SCAN
    
    If he finds one of these that leads AWAY from the player, he will take it.
                                
    When a ninja gets to the end of a track he will then search again for for a
    track leading away from the player.  Theoretically you would be able to
    chase a fleeing ninja ALL THE WAY ACROSS A MAP if tracks were set up
    nicely.
    
LOGIC: FIND PLAYER

    A ninja can try to find the player via a track if 
        A) Ninja is moving toward player and is blocked by something.
        B) Ninja looses sight of player.

    If Player is above, looks for track types nearby in this order.
        1. TT_LADDER
        2. TT_STAIRS
        3. TT_JUMP_UP
        4. TT_TRAVERSE
        5. TT_SCAN
        6. TT_EXIT
    
    If Player is below, looks for track types nearby in this order.
        1. TT_JUMP_DOWN
        2. TT_TRAVERSE
        3. TT_SCAN
        4. TT_EXIT

    If Player is at same level, looks for track types nearby in this order.
        1. TT_TRAVERSE
        2. TT_EXIT
        3. TT_SCAN
        
    If he finds one of these that leads CLOSER to the player, he will take it.
    
LOGIC: WANDER

    When loosing sight of the player, a ninja can then choose to wander.
          
    Looks for track types nearby in this order.
    
        1. TT_DUCK_N_SHOOT
        2. TT_HIDE_N_SHOOT
        3. TT_WANDER
        4. TT_JUMP_DOWN
        5. TT_JUMP_UP
        6. TT_TRAVERSE
        7. TT_STAIRS
        8. TT_LADDER
        9. TT_EXIT
    
    
IMPORTANT NOTE: Currently when searching for track types, actors stop looking
after they find the first satisfactory track.  This is NOT optimal.  Should
search through all types for the best case.  This will be fixed in the future.

HISTORY

10/12/94
--------

Add description of walls vs. points a top of file.

SINK tags now have hi-tags working.

Deleted swinging door tags

10/28/94
--------

Add description of Z coordinates VS pixels at the top of file.

Updated Sine Wave Floor tags.

Sector object tags had some wrong info. Re-read.

11/3/94
--------

Added the following for sine wave walls. Not documented yet.
    TAG_WALL_SINE_Y_BEGIN 300
    TAG_WALL_SINE_X_BEGIN 301
    TAG_WALL_SINE_Y_END 302
    TAG_WALL_SINE_X_END 303
    
Added TAG_ROTATE_SO_SWITCH 304.

Documented sine wave walls.

11/6/94
-------

Tagging conflicts for sinking water were occuring for things like the whirlpool
and waves.  The following explains how sector information can be extended with
sprites.  This works because a sprite KNOWS what sector it is in.  I just delete
the sprites after I get the info out of them.

    1. Sinking items such as water do not need to be tagged anymore.  Use
    sprites as follows.
    2. To set the depth place a sprite  on the sector to be sinkable and set
    its lotag to the depth you want.  Put picnum number 2307 (has the text ST1
    for a pic) on the sprite.
    3. Hitag is the type of data and the lotag is usually the actual data.
    See the chart below.
    4. I plan on using this technique lots in the future for setting extra tags.
    5. Look in actor.map for examples.
   
    ----------------------------------------------------
    |       TYPE                    |   DATA is in     |
    ----------------------------------------------------
    | name                   hitag  | lotag  | other   |
    ---------------------------------------------------- 
    SECT_SINK                  0      depth
    SECT_RESERVED              1
    SECT_DAMAGE               2      amt    
    SECT_CURRENT               3      speed    angle of sprite   
    SECT_ANGLE                16               angle of sprite
    SECT_HEIGHT               17      height   
    SECT_SPEED                18      speed
    
    NOTE 0-15 are used for true/false (is this sector sinkable - TRUE) settings
    along with data.  Others are used just for data.
    
I've placed this table at the top of the file. I will maintain it.

NEW TAGS

Changed  TAG_WALL_DONT_SPIN 500   

Changed the way panning works.  Look at chart above.

Changed hitag of 
#define TAG_STAIRS_DOWN_SWITCH  241
#define TAG_STAIRS_DOWN_START   242

Added
#define TAG_WALL_LOOP_REVERSE_SPIN 501                                             
#define TAG_WALL_LOOP_SPIN_2X 502                                             
#define TAG_WALL_LOOP_SPIN_4X 503         

IMPORTANT:

Changed the way SO's are bounded.  A bounding sector is no longer needed.  I use bounding
sprites (upper left and lower right) and tag the outer SO loop.  See examples.                                     

Using bounding sectors would slow things down under certain situations and make other 
thing impossible to do (like rotating interlocking gears).

Note do not spit the outer sector if at all possible.  Call me if you need to do this.

Added the following documentation to the Actor Track Section

// For placing actor sprite on the tracks:
//      1. Put a sprite down near the point you want it to start from.
//      2. Adjust the angle to the left to make the sprite move in the "reverse" direction
//         and to the right to make the sprite move in the "forward" direction.
//      3. For the pic, place the first pic of the actor found in the editart file.
